TokenAnnotator --> had to include Standord CoreNLP tools because no models for French and Spanish in OpenNLP
TokenTypeAnnotator --> no language-specific modifications necessary
SyllableAnnotater --> language-specific syllable pattern; define whether silent e is considered in language (no for both)
SentenceAnnotator --> had to include Standord CoreNLP tools because no models for French and Spanish in OpenNLP
LetterAnnotator --> no language-specific modifications necessary
POSAnnotator --> had to include Stanford CoreNLP tools; uses UD tagset --> had to implement language-specific word categories (problem: cannot distinguish finite verbs (necessary for DLT integration cost))
DependencyParseAnnotator --> include Stanford CoreNLP tools; uses UD tagset --> implement language-specific categories
LemmatizerAnnotator --> just include lanugage models for Mate and update mate
MorphologicalAnalyzerAnnotator --> just include language models for Mate

MeanSentenceLength --> no language-specific modifications necessary
NLetter --> no language-specific modifications necessary
NSentence --> no language-specific modifications necessary
NSyllable --> no language-specific modifications necessary
NToken --> no language-specific modifications necessary
NTokenType --> no language-specific modifications necessary
MeanTokenLength --> no language-specific modifications necessary
SDSentenceLength --> no language-specific modifications necessary
SDTokenLength --> no language-specific modifications necessary
TypeTokenRatio --> no language-specific modifications necessary
POSDensity --> decide for each POS whether it is available in UD tagset and make available only for these POSs; no additional tags which have no correspondent to the existing ones of other languages
LexicalVariationVerb --> no language-specific modifications necessary
LexicalVariation --> no language-specific modifications necessary
NSyntacticConstituent --> Fragments are not supported, because parser doesn't distinguish them. All features need language-specific tregex expressions to extract them from the parse trees
SyntacticComplexity --> no language-specific modifications (all features supported because based on NSyntacticConstituent but fragments not used)
LexicalSophistication --> those for which lists with forms (not lemmas) could be found. Lists with lemmas are compiled but not implemented because no lemmatizers are available from any libraries in Java for French or Spanish
Words with 2 or more syllables --> nothing else needed (only language-specific syllable annotator)
DLTIntegrationCost --> had to use morphological analysis to determine finite verbs becaus POS tagset does not support that
PropositionalIdeaDensity --> feature had to be developed from scratch; had to add elements in word categories to apply rules defined in CPIDR

NConnectives --> external lists of Breindl connectives
CohesiveComplexity --> builds on NConnectives
